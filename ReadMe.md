# Personal Website Project

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a personal website to showcase information about myself, detailing who I am and sharing various aspects of my life.

## Technologies Used
### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) will structure the content of the web pages, providing a framework for presenting information.

### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) will be used to design and style the website, ensuring it looks visually appealing and cohesive.

### Python
Python will likely be used in the backend development or for implementing certain functionalities, enhancing the website's interactivity and features.

## Content
The website will contain sections such as:
- **About Me**: Personal information, background, interests, and hobbies.
- **Projects**: Showcase of personal projects, work, or creative endeavors.
- **Blog/Articles**: Writing pieces, thoughts, or experiences I want to share.
- **Contact**: How to get in touch with me or connect on social platforms.

## Approach
The project will be approached in phases:
1. **Planning**: Outlining the structure, content, and design elements.
2. **Implementation**: Using HTML and CSS to create the website layout and style.
3. **Functionality**: Integrating Python for any dynamic features or backend operations.
4. **Testing & Deployment**: Ensuring the website works smoothly across devices before deployment.

## Expectations
By the end of this project, I aim to have a personalized, functional, and visually appealing website that represents who I am and what I'm passionate about.
